# YouTube-views-prediction-using-ML
A Machine Learning project for the CS-C3240 course. In this project, I used Linear and Polynomial regression to predict the views on YouTube videos of the 5-Minute Crafts channel.<br>

The purpose of the project is to predict the number of views on certain videos, given the video titles. Current results are promising but there are a few improvements to be made. Further discussion of the methods can be viewed in the report pdf, and the codes of the project can also be found.<br>

<b>Note:</b> As the project was done without a git repo at first, only the final results of the project are available.
